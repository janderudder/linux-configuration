# Linux configuration

My Linux/WSL setup.

Some placeholders are used throughout the files in `src/`.

- `__USER_NAME__` your Linux user name
- `__WIN_USER_NAME__` your Windows user name (WSL host)

Other such placeholders are application specific.

The `tool/` folder contains one time use configuration files and helpers.
